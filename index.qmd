# Florida County Census Analysis and Map:

Here are the steps I took in order to find the data below:

1.  The first step was to upload the census key so that all the data would be in PositCloud for me to pull from
2.  I then has to upload the median ages, income and population for the US so that the data would be properly uploaded
3.  I then pulled these different variables for Florida since that was my chosen state
4.  I did this by gathering the data from the 2017-2021 ACS, using the feature geometry from the census I was able to use simple feature collection to obtain only the data I needed
5.  I then was able to use the code to put it into map view
