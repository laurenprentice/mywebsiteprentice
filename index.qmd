# Florida County Census Analysis and Map:

Here are the steps I took in order to find the data below:

1.  The first step was to upload the census key so that all the data would be in PositCloud for me to pull from
2.  I then has to upload the median ages, income and population for the US so that the data would be properly uploaded
3.  I then pulled these different variables for Florida since that was my chosen state![](Screen Shot 2023-12-13 at 5.12.36 PM.png)
